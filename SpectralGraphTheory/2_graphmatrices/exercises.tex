\begin{exercise}
Let $G$ be an undirected graph with unit edge weights.  A \emph{walk} of length $t \in Z_+$ between vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is a sequence of vertices $(u=v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_t=v)$ such that $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \in E$ for all $i \in \{0,\ldots, t-1\}.$ 
Show that, for all $t \in \Z_+$: 
$$
(A^t)_{i,j} = \textrm{Number of walks of length $t$ between vertices $i$ and $j$}
$$
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
Let $G$ be an undirected graph and $L$ its Laplacian matrix. Show that the vector $\mathbf{1}:= (1, ... , 1) \in \R^n$ is an eigenvector of $L$. What is the corresponding eigenvalue?
