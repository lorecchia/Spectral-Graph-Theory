\begin{exercise}
Show that the Hessian of $f(x)$ at a critical point $x_0$ with  $\|x_0\| = 1$ is
$$
\nabla^2 f(x) = 2M - 2 f(x_0) I.
$$
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
Let $M$ be a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix. Use the spectral decomposition of $M$ to show that there exists an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $M^{1/2}$ such that:
\[
	\left(M^{1/2}\right)^2 = M
\]
\end{exercise}
